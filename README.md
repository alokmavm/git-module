# git-module

After making the changes in your local there are mainly three steps we need to do. 

1. stage your changes ===> git add "<file name>" or if you want to add all file then git add * 
2. commit your changes ===> git commit -m "<your message>"
3. push your changes ==== > git push origin/"<your branch name>"

git is very useful too we must learn it!


to create a branch we need to give command like
git checkout -b "<branch name>"
